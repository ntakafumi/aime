# **AIME:**Approximate Inverse Model Explanations
The AIME methodology is detailed in the paper available at The AIME methodology is detailed in the paper available at [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247033](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247033). AIME is proposed to address the challenges faced by existing methods in providing intuitive explanations for black-box models. AIME offers unified global and local feature importance by deriving approximate inverse operators for black-box models. It introduces a representative instance similarity distribution plot, aiding comprehension of the predictive behavior of the model and target dataset.
## Features
- **Unified Global and Local Feature Importance**: AIME derives approximate inverse operators for black-box models, offering insights into both global and local feature importance.
* **Representative Instance Similarity Distribution Plot**: This feature aids in understanding the predictive behavior of the model and the target dataset, illustrating the relationship between different predictions.
* **Effective Across Diverse Data Types**: AIME has been tested and proven effective across various data types, including tabular data, handwritten digit images, and text data.
* **Intuitive Explanations**: AIME's explanations are simpler and more intuitive than those generated by well-established methods like LIME and SHAP.
* **Visualization of Similarity Distribution**: AIME visualizes the similarity distribution with the target dataset, providing insights into the relationship between different predictions.

# **PCTAIME** :PCAIME: Principal Component Analysis-Enhanced Approximate Inverse Model Explanations Through Dimensional Decomposition and Expansion
Please refer to PCAIME.ipynb when implementing.

# **HuberAIME** : 
AIME is based on the least squares method, so it has the disadvantage of being weak against outliers. If you want to include data with outliers, please use it as “AIME (use_huber=True)”.
