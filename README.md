The AIME methodology is detailed in the paper available at The AIME methodology is detailed in the paper available at [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247033](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247033). AIME is proposed to address the challenges faced by existing methods in providing intuitive explanations for black-box models. AIME offers unified global and local feature importance by deriving approximate inverse operators for black-box models. It introduces a representative instance similarity distribution plot, aiding comprehension of the predictive behavior of the model and target dataset.
## Features
- **Unified Global and Local Feature Importance**: AIME derives approximate inverse operators for black-box models, offering insights into both global and local feature importance.
* **Representative Instance Similarity Distribution Plot**: This feature aids in understanding the predictive behavior of the model and the target dataset, illustrating the relationship between different predictions.
* **Effective Across Diverse Data Types**: AIME has been tested and proven effective across various data types, including tabular data, handwritten digit images, and text data.
* **Intuitive Explanations**: AIME's explanations are simpler and more intuitive than those generated by well-established methods like LIME and SHAP.
* **Visualization of Similarity Distribution**: AIME visualizes the similarity distribution with the target dataset, providing insights into the relationship between different predictions.

# **PCTAIME** :
PCAIME (Principal Component Analysis-Enhanced AIME) extends the Approximate Inverse Model Explanations framework by integrating dimensional decomposition and expansion using PCA.
It not only estimates global and local feature importance but also explicitly visualizes multicollinearity and correlations among features through heat maps of principal components.
This approach provides more comprehensive and interpretable insights into feature interactions than conventional XAI methods like LIME, SHAP, or AIME alone.

# **HuberAIME** : 
HuberAIME is a robust extension of Approximate Inverse Model Explanations (AIME) that integrates the Huber loss to mitigate the influence of outliers.
By applying iterative reweighted least squares, it downweights extreme residuals and stabilizes global feature importance estimation.
This method preserves AIME’s efficiency on clean data while significantly improving reliability and fidelity in datasets with noisy or outlier-prone samples  If you want to include data with outliers, please use it as “AIME (use_huber=True)”.

# **BayesianAIME** :
Bayesian-AIME is a Bayesian extension of AIME that treats the model’s inverse operator as a random variable, yielding a closed-form posterior over feature-importance rather than a single point estimate. It attaches 95% credible intervals to both global and local attributions, enabling quantitative confidence in explanations while preserving AIME’s point estimate under an empirical-prior baseline. Experiments show improved stability versus LIME/SHAP and calibrated uncertainty on synthetic and real datasets. Please use it as "AIME(use_Bayesian=True)"
